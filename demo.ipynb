       " Paragraph(id='Par2', references=[], text='Graphite is a carbon material with a layered structure in which the distance between the layers is about 35.3 Å, in which there is a suitable space between the layers for the placement of lithium atoms [1–4]. During charging, lithium ions are reduced in the anode and converted to lithium atoms, which are placed between the graphite layers. After the arrival of lithium, the distance between the plates reaches 3.5 Å [5–10]. During discharge, the lithium atoms are oxidized to lithium ions and transported through the electrolyte to the cathode. Due to the insertion of lithium atoms in graphite (at the time of charging), these materials are called intercalation anodes [6–14]. According to Fig. 1 in graphite, a maximum of one lithium atom can be stored for every 6 carbon atoms [5]. Because capacity is directly related to the amount of lithium stored, graphite has a lower capacity than lithium metal anodes, but as mentioned earlier, it is used as a commercial anode because it does not have dendritic growth problems. Note that in this article and future articles, the anode and cathode means the active substance in the anode and cathode [6–8]. Due to the low capacity of graphite, anodes with high capacity are required [15–18]. A group of anodes that can store large amounts of lithium atoms are alloy-type anodes made of metal or semiconductors. The function of these anodes is to form an alloy with a metal or semiconductor, thereby storing the lithium atom [19–21]. In this type of material, compared to graphite, where only one lithium atom is stored for every 6 carbon atoms, several lithium atoms can be stored for each metal atom [9–11]. The most important of these anodes are silicon, and antimony. For silicon the capacity is about 4000 mAh/g and for tin the mentioned capacity is 900 mAh/g compared to graphite which has a capacity of about 350 mAh/g. According to Fig. 2, among alloy anodes, silicon has the highest volume and weight capacity, is found in abundance in nature, and the entire electronics industry is based on silicon; Thus, as Fig. 2 shows, silicon is the most important of the alloy anodes [12–15]. Therefore, most of the material in this article is about silicon, but the principles mentioned can be generalized to other alloy anodes. Active anode material, Theoretical capacity, Advantages and study results are presented in Table 1.'),\n",

       " Paragraph(id='Par3', references=[], text='In these anodes, the storage and release of lithium is accompanied by a large volume change that can reach up to 400% of the initial volume, as shown in Fig.\\xa03. During the work cycle, due to the stresses caused by volume change, the phenomenon of pulverization of active substances occurs [7, 10, 39, 40]. Fragmentation causes the connection between the active material itself, between the active conductive–additive material and between the active-collecting active substance to be cut off [18–20]. When this phenomenon occurs, the active substance is electrically isolated; therefore, electron transfer does not take place to carry out the oxidation reaction. Therefore, a large volume of active ingredients remains unused and do not participate in capacity, and ultimately this causes a sharp drop in capacity during the work cycle [21, 41, 42]. Figure\\xa03 shows the crushing phenomenon. Unfortunately, Fig.\\xa03 does not show the entire structure of the anode electrode. In fact, in a conventional electrode, micron particles of active materials are used along with binders and carbon conductive materials, etc. [43–46]. Which is broken if the electronic connections mentioned above are broken. Figure\\xa04 shows the charge and discharge curves for silicon particles measuring 10 microns. It can be seen that the capacity even at the first discharge is only 800\\xa0mAh/g (compared to the initial 4000 charged). In graphite, on the other hand, capacity decreases by only 0.03 per work cycle. These anodes have a higher voltage than graphite (according to the formula stated earlier, the higher the anode voltage, the lower the battery voltage) [10, 21, 39]. For example, silicon has a voltage of 0.3 to 0.4 higher than lithium, while in graphite the voltage is about 0.05\\xa0V higher than lithium, but silicon and other alloy anodes have such a high capacity that the voltage does not have a significant effect, and the energy is significantly higher than graphite.'),\n",

Research has shown that when the dimensions of silicon reach the nanometer range (less than 150\\xa0nm), the crushing phenomenon no longer occurs [47–50]. Figure\\xa05 shows the TEM image of silicon nanoparticles during lithium ionization. These two particles change volume due to the entry of lithium, but do not break under stress [7, 18, 40]. This shows that in order to use the extraordinary capacity of silicon, we must inevitably go to the nanoscale [51–53]. If nanoparticles are used, the problem of fragmentation is solved, but they are not normally connected to the electron supply. Therefore, for the first time, the researchers used silicon nanowires grown vertically on a current collector as shown in Fig.\\xa06 (SEM image). In this way, the problem of crushing can be solved, because there is enough space between the nanowires to change the volume of each nanowire during the duty cycle without generating extensive stress, the diameter of each nanowire is also less than the critical dimension [19–22, 30, 54–56]. As it is known, after alloying (entry of lithium), the width of the nanowires increased and the side walls became textured, and although there was a large volume change, no fragmentation occurred [57]. In nanowires, electron transfer (communication between the current collector and the active substance) takes place through the length of the nanowires. Since the electron transfer is good, the full capacity of the silicon active material can be used [31, 32, 35–37]. Nanowires have a higher electrolyte bond season than bulk material [41–43]. Due to the fact that the oxidation reaction takes place through the electrode–electrolyte interface, the speed of the reactions also increases. on the other hand, because nanowires have small dimensions compared to the bulk material that ions have to travel longer distances, ion transfer through lateral dimensions is easy. Faster ion transfers and oxidation reactions increase power and even energy, because ion transfer (sometimes in addition to electron transfer) is a potential loss (concentration polarization) of both the anode and cathode electrodes of a lithium battery, this polarization decreases as the penetration distance decreases and the energy density improves [44–46]. Finally, because silicon is a semiconductor, it has less electron conductivity than graphite, which is a metalloid [33, 38, 58].'),\n",

In nanotubes, the necessary space is provided for volume change on both sides of the inner and outer walls [34, 59–61]. In addition, nanotubes are usually thinner than nanowires, so transmitters are better, because silicon is a semiconductor and is also amorphous during the duty cycle due to stresses, it does not conduct well electronically during the duty cycle [47, 48, 54]. As a result, electrons do not flow well in all parts of the silicon. Hybrid nanostructures can be used to solve this problem, for example a silicon nanotube whose core contains conductive materials or vice versa has a conductive coating [62–66]. A comparison between the two categories of uncoated and carbon-coated silicon nanowires has shown that carbon-coated nanowires maintain considerable capacity. Another solution is to use nanocomposite anodes [49–51]. One of the most widely used materials in nanocomposites in the role of stress modulator (buffer) is carbon. For example, carbon nanocomposite in the field of carbon is one of the solutions to the stress problem. Figure\\xa07 shows a Tin–carbon nanocomposite. Tin acts as an active ingredient as an alloy anode. Carbon in this nanocomposite acts as both a buffer and a conductor, and in addition to their various carbon structures, they can store some lithium. As shown in Fig.\\xa07, the tin capacity is less than the theoretical capacity (900\\xa0mAh/g) due to the presence of carbon, but has a good cycle life.

       " Paragraph(id='Par6', references=[], text='The question may arise in the mind of the reader as to why other alloy anodes are being explored, given that silicon has a much higher capacity than other alloy anodes [71–73]. The answer that is given and can be generalized to the whole collection of nanotechnology and battery articles is that because nanomaterials are synthesized in different ways and with different morphologies (shapes) in different ways [74–78]. Each synthesis method is different from the discussion of price, quality, safety, scalability, environmental effects, etc.; for example, metals cannot be prepared with the sol–gel method, which is a simple method [79–81]. Even for a specific material such as silicon, one-dimensional nanomaterials, such as nanofibers, can be produced by electrospinning, which is a mass-produced method, in the form of nanowires by the expensive chemical vapor deposition method, another method for laboratory testing [22, 52–54]. Nanowires can be fabricated by silicon etching. In the latter method, the crystalline direction and doping can be easily controlled, and the effect of different dopants and crystalline directions on lithium storage can be determined [23, 82–88]. Even a nanomaterial with a specific shape and composition can be used in different ways and even in a specific method, different reactants can be used with different temperature conditions, etc., each of which may have different results in terms of price, safety and since the key to commercialization other than investing is to find the right production method by considering the factors listed above, so there is an inseparable link between production and performance in batteries and very good and appropriate articles Available in connection with the synthesis method [30, 31, 56, 57, 89–92]. In addition to one-dimensional nanostructures (nanowires and nanotubes), efforts have been made to use zero-dimensional nanostructures (nanoparticles) (as a good nanoparticle are easier to synthesize than nanowires). The problem with nanoparticles is that on the one hand it is not possible to easily make a connection between the nanoparticles themselves and on the other hand between them and the conductive and collecting material [32, 35, 36]. For example, Fig.\\xa08a shows that the primary nanoparticles (left of the image) increase in volume after absorbing lithium during charging, and after a few cycles, disconnect the electron connection when it returns to its original state without lithium [3, 24, 93–95]. In the usual method of preparing the anode (also the cathode), the powder of the active substance (here silicon) is used together with the conductive carbon (to improve the conductivity) and the PDVF binder (for the bonding of the particles) shown in Fig.\\xa08b. According to Figure b, because the silicon nanoparticles change volume, after returning to another initial state, the electrical connection between the nanoparticles, the carbon conductive material is lost, the capacity is reduced. To solve the above problem in the method shown in Figure c, amorphous silicon, which also has a stress-modulating role, is used as an adhesive to bond silicon nanoparticles so that the electrical connection is no longer interrupted and the capacity will remain [25, 37, 38, 96, 97]. In another method, nanoparticles in the field of polyaniline conductive polymer, which have both a modulating and electron conducting role, have been prepared and observed to have a good cycle life of 1000 while maintaining a capacity of 1600\\xa0mAh/g. In comparison, the PVDF binder method loses more than 50% of its capacity in 100 working cycles. Another way to solve the problem is hollow nanostructures. In this method, the necessary empty space is provided during the entry and exit of lithium through a hollow volume [26, 27, 33, 58, 59]. The finite element method shows that in the same volume, the hollow structure undergoes less stress during the work cycle, so they have better resistance to the crushing phenomenon (Fig.\\xa09).'),\n",

That is why we can decompose (electrolyze) water to produce hydrogen and oxygen. These cells are the opposite of galvanic cells (batteries), called electrolyte cells. In these cells, unlike the battery, we give energy to force a reaction that is not thermodynamically desirable [60].'),\n",
       " Paragraph(id='Par8', references=[], text='When charging the battery, just like decomposing water, we give energy to the battery through the charger to reverse the reaction that took place in the battery and return the battery to its pre-discharged state [100–104]. The organic electrolyte used in lithium-ion batteries (such as water electrolysis) changes as a result of the energy from the charger. As mentioned, in a lithium-ion battery, at the negative pole (graphite anode), lithium-ion reduction occurs during charging. Due to the fact that the tendency to electrolyte reduction is thermodynamically higher than lithium ion, so electrolyte reduction is done instead of lithium ion reduction. This causes a solid layer to form on the graphite surface. This solid layer is called SEI (solid electrolyte interface). The composition of this layer is complex and a mixture of several chemicals. Figure\\xa010 shows a schematic of this layer. As can be seen from the figure, the composition of this substance contains lithium ions and carbon; therefore, the formation of this layer is accompanied by a decrease in lithium, which reduces the capacity in the first charge [34, 61]. This layer of thickness is in the nanometer range as shown in Fig.\\xa010. The formation of the SEI layer itself limits the continuation of the electrolyte reduction reaction, because it prevents the electrolyte molecules from reaching the graphite anode surface as a physical barrier. In fact, it acts as a kinetic inhibitor (like the passive layer of aluminum oxide, which prevents oxygen from reaching the lower aluminum and prevents the rest of the aluminum from oxidizing). On the other hand, because it is an electron insulator, it also prevents the electron from reaching the electrolyte [62–65]. Therefore, neither the electron can reach the electrolyte molecule nor the electrolyte molecule can move towards the electron in the anode, both of which cause the electrolyte to regenerate and have a self-limiting reaction. Fortunately, this layer is permeable to lithium ions, and lithium ions can pass through it to the anode surface, capture electrons, and regenerate [105–108]. This layer reduces battery power as it increases the penetration distance of the lithium ion to reach the anode [109–111].'),\n",

       " Paragraph(id='Par10', references=[], text='In general, for anodes less than one volt relative to lithium metal, the electrolyte is unstable and SEI is formed. Hence, SEI is formed in the silicon anode, which has a potential of 0.3 to 0.4 higher than lithium [112–115]. Unfortunately, because silicon changes volume and breaks down, new levels of silicon are exposed to the electrolyte, so the electron reaches the electrolyte and a new SEI is formed on these new surfaces. As a result, capacity is constantly reduced during work cycles. It is necessary to say this, because tests are often performed on lithium metal, voltages relative to lithium are measured in all battery articles [69]. In silicon nanomaterials, because of the higher chemical activity, it is even more susceptible to the formation of SEI. In the case of nanomaterials, it is true that they do not break down, but they do change volume. According to Fig.\\xa012, this volume change causes SEI to grow continuously and we see the disadvantages of SEI growth, such as reduced capacity and power, and so on. Figure\\xa013 of section a better illustrates the reason for SEI growth in nanomaterials. If we have the cross section of a nanowire (or nanoparticles, etc.) in the initial state without lithium, shown on the left side of the figure, during charging, because the silicon is lithium-containing, its volume increases and due to electrolyte instability at the same time an SEI layer is formed on the nanowire [116–119]. Now during discharge, the lithium comes out and the particle shrinks while the SEI does not shrink. This causes the SEI to crumble under stress (or even in the second stage of silicon enlargement under lithium ionization, at which point stress occurs and the SEI crumbles because the exact boundary between the SEI and the particle does not exactly match). Therefore, when recharging (lithium ionization), a new SEI layer is formed again. Repetition of this cycle leads to continuous SEI growth and we have problems with its growth, while in graphite SEI would not grow without a slight change in its volume. It should be noted that what has been said about SEI and silicon also applies to other alloy anodes [70, 120–123]. As seen in section b, this problem also exists for silicon nanotubes, but if we can somehow prevent the silicon from coming into contact with the electrolyte from the beginning and changing its volume in the vicinity of the electrolyte, this problem will be solved.'),\n",

[18] used a mechanical locking layer as shown in Fig.\\xa013c; this layer, which is made of silicon oxide, prevents the change in the outer volume of the nanotubes due to its mechanical strength. Thus a stable SEI is formed without changing the volume (a stable SEI layer like graphite). This oxide layer is the conductor of lithium ions so it does not cause a problem to react. The necessary space for volume change is also provided through the inner wall of the nanotube. So there is no problem of crushing. Because the study showed that the electrolyte does not penetrate into the nanotube, there is no contact between the electrolyte and the inner wall of the nanotube. All these advantages make it offer a long cycle life and good power. Figure\\xa014 (shown in this figure with DWSiNT) shows part of the deep discharge cycles of this sample. In deep discharge, the cycle life is always reduced faster. However, it is observed that after 900 cycles, the prepared sample still has a good capacity, but the normal nanotube and nanowire samples lose their capacity rapidly. Discharged) For the plotted sample, it shows that the capacity maintains its capacity even after this relatively high C rate even at up to 6000 open cycles. In another example [19], a core–shell structure is prepared, as shown in Fig.\\xa015c, a carbon coating is used with silicon nanoparticles inside the carbon coating. The thickness of the carbon coating is in the range of 10\\xa0nm and includes 100\\xa0nm silicon particles. The carbon shell is provided with enough space to easily change the volume of the silicon nanoparticle, as shown in Figure c. On the other hand, silicon nanoparticles are attached to the carbon shell from one point, so electron and ionic transitions take place in it, because carbon is in the vicinity of the electrolyte and not silicon, like graphite, a stable SEI is formed without crushing because the change in volume of silicon is not transferred to carbon and from carbon to SEI, so similar to the figure in Fig.\\xa012, it has a long cycle life. If we use silicon nanoparticles normally, in addition to the SEI problem, as we saw in the previous article and Figure a, it shows that there is no empty space between the silicon nanoparticles to change the volume, so there is stress between the particles when they change volume, but when Using this hollow structure (Figure b) there is no longer any stress between the particles.'),\n",

Lithium ion positive is generated. This repulsive force prevents more ions from entering the network.

The difference between Nano and Nano performance is also quite clear. As shown in Fig.\\xa026, the amount of reversible lithium (which can be removed during charging) for Nano is much higher than the corresponding amount for bulk. This shows that the capacity that can be recovered after the initial charge is much better in Nano than in micro.

In the composition it has changed from the range of less than 0.5 ions to 1 ion), according to this, the capacity offered in Nano is much more than bulk. In the micron-sized anode of Fe2O3 (hematite), before the exchange reaction begins, about 0.1\\xa0mol of lithium ion per mole of oxide compound can be stored in the lattice, but above this critical limit, the exchange reaction takes place; on the other hand, when we increase the dimensions of iron oxide particles to 20\\xa0nm, the amount of lithium stored in degrees reaches 1\\xa0mol, which causes a volume change of only about 1%.

So far it has been said that Nano makes volume change easier without failure, but here it can be seen that even Nano has reduced the amount of volume change from a few percent for the exchange reaction to one percent for a degree reaction. The reason for this change is the storage mechanism for iron oxide due to thermodynamic problems. The opposite happens for the Co3O4 anode because it is kinetic and is related to the current density (the current density is obtained by dividing the current by the surface); when the current is constant, in the Nano-dimensions, because the surface is higher, the current density decreases and the Co3O4 anode shows exchange behavior, but in the micro, due to the high current density, the anode shows the insertion behavior [76–79].'),\n",
