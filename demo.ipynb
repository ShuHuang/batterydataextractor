The enhanced electrochemical performance can be due to that the double walls of carbon and SiO2 improve the electronic conductivity and enhance the compatibility of electrode materials and electrolyte as a result of accommodating the significant volumetric change during cycles.

Among various anode materials, silicon is very attractive for the next generation high-energy rechargeable lithium-ion batteries because of its highest theoretical specific capacity of 4,200 mAh G−1 and satisfactory potentials for lithium ion insertion and extraction [1]. In addition, the silicon as anode materials has the advantages of abundance in nature and environmentally friendly. However, the large volume changes of Si during lithium ion insertion and extraction lead to the pulverization of the electrode materials and thus causing the decay of capacity with cycling [2, 3]. Moreover, the low electronic conductivity of Si can cause the polarization of electrode during cycling process.'),\n",
       " Paragraph(id='Sec1', references=[], text='To overcome these problems, many strategies have been implemented, especially focusing on reducing the silicon particle size and preparation of silicon/carbon composites. Various nanostructured silicon materials (silicon nanoparticles [4], silicon nanotubes [5], silicon hollow nanospheres [6], silicon nanowires [7], silicon nanonests [8], silicon nanoarrays [9]) exhibit improved electrochemical performance because nanosized silicon could buffer volume stress and shorten the Li-ion diffusion path lengths. In addition, silicon/carbon composites (silicon/carbon nanorods [10], silicon/carbon nanospheres [11], silicon/graphene nanosheets [12], silicon/carbon nanotubes [13], silicon/carbon nanofibers [14], silicon/graphite [15], silicon/fullerene [16]) have been widely studied to improve the cycling stability. The carbon can prevent aggregation of Si nanoparticles and improve electronic conductivity of electrode. Furthermore, carbon coating can release the mechanical stress caused by large volume changes of Si during charge/discharge process and protect the Si electrode from direct contact with the electrolyte due to the superior chemical and electrochemical stabilities of carbon, thus stabilizing the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer and enhancing the cycle life of Si-based electrodes. Core-shell-structured Si/C composite can combine the advantages of silicon core (high capacity) and carbon shell (long cycle life and high electronic conductivity). Core-shell-structured Si/C nanocomposites have been prepared to obtain a stable capacity because of the homogeneous distribution of Si nanoparticles in carbon matrix [17, 18]. Core-shell-structured Si/C composites are usually formed by mixing active materials with carbon precursor and then heat treatment at high temperature in an inert atmosphere. It is difficult to form a uniform carbon layer on the surface of active particles due to the weak interface bond between active materials and carbon coating. Su et al. report the SiO2 layer is beneficial to coating a dense carbon layer on silicon [19].'),\n",

The interlayer SiO2 on the surface of Si nanoparticles could provide a flexible cushion in the Si@SiO2@C nanocomposite to accommodate stress and volume changes. In addition, the interlayer SiO2 also could enhance the adhesion between silicon core and carbon shell.
