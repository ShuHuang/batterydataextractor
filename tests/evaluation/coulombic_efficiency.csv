","The second discharge plateau has been attributed to byproducts of VO(acac)2 formation, but since the vanadyl species appears to be cyclable, its formation should not be associated with significant coulombic efficiency loss. Due to the long time-scale of the experiment, a 30% coulombic efficiency loss could owe in part to crossover of the active species through the separator, either by diffusion or by migration.
